        ! - mergetubemeth       method to merge tubes, either 'extensive' or 'local'. 
        !                       the extensive method considers several 
        !                       tubes at the same time and often leads 
        !                       to 'nicer' tubes for grid generation, but
        !                       may not be able to merge some tubes when 
        !                       when cycles are present in the tube graph.
        !                       the local method considers only two tubes
        !                       at the same time and can therefore merge    
        !                       more tube pairs, but may lead to uglier tubes. 
        ! - dpsimintubes        minimal psi difference for topomesh tubes (below
        !                       which we try to merge - set to 0 to ignore)

        ! - lpolsepmin          minimal separatrix face length in poloidal direction.
        !                       If lower, separatrix faces can be removed
        !                       during separatrix simplification step
        ! - mtallowseparatrix   allow merging over the separatrix for 
        !                       the general merge case
        ! - mtallowcore, mtallowpf  same as separatrix, but for core and 
        !                       pf contours
        ! - alignvesselparts    define certain vessel parts as aligned 
        !                       faces with a certain flux surface value 
        !                       and flux surface ID. Only certain boundary
        !                       faces will be considered for alignment 
        !                       (typically those near type 2 tangency 
        !                       points). This will only be done after
        !                       initial topological mesh construction 
        !                       as this triggers profound adaptation of     
        !                       of the topomesh.
        ! - avpminangle         minimum angle w.r.t. the magnetic field 
        !                       of boundary edges. If below, it will be
        !                       considered as potential aligned part 
        !                       (avp: aligned vessel parts). This angle
        !                       should be given in degrees!

        !============
        ! Options for the grid generator, including vertex distribution 
        ! options (poloidal and radial), flux surface removal options, 
        ! boundary triangle removal options, and small face removal 
        ! options. The following fields are present: 

        ! General grid generation
        ! - verbosity       the higher, the more information is

        ! - ggmethod        method how to construct the grid. Can be 
        !                   'independent' (treating each flux surface
        !                    independently) or 'orthogonal' (
        !                   yields largely orthogonal grid, but needs 
        !                   dependency between mesh cells)
        ! - cellconstructionmethod: method how to determine grid cells
        !                   starting from given vertex distribution.

        ! - TMcellgriddingorder:    order in which to grid the 
        !                   topological mesh cells. Can be 'independent'
        !                   (then it is  pretty much random) or

        !                   one. Here, initial distributions are

        !                       densitybased option: x, y are

        !                       val is the desired density at the point
        ! - vdpddensityatvessel:    desired density at the vessel boundary

        !                           boundary 

        ! Vertex distribution, radial direction:
        ! largely the same as poloidal one (but then vdr instead of vdp)
        ! but some differences
        ! - vdrtype:        (same as vdptype)
        ! - vdrdoxp:            include x-points? (for refinement in core region)
